# Personal website of Davide Valeriani (www.davidevaleriani.it)

The website serves as my online CV, but also includes notes used by hundreds of students at the University of Parma pursuing the degree in Computer Engineering. Feel free to use the design and/or the source code (mostly HTML) at your own risk.
